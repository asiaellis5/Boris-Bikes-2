# Boris Bikes Project

## Overview

First Pair Programming weekly challenge taken at Makers Academy. A simple program run on the command line which was built to emulate the popular bike borrowing system in London. It runs different docking stations and allows the user to dock and borrow bikes based on availability and whether the bike is broken.

## Setup

First clone this repo

Then to install all the dependencies needed, run:

```
bundle install
```

Then use IRB to interact with the program

## How to run the tests

Once all the dependecies are installed run:

```
rspec
```



## User Stories

```
As a person,
So that I can use a bike,
I'd like a docking station to release a bike.

As a person,
So that I can use a good bike,
I'd like to see if a bike is working
```
